Module 14 Challenge for Morgan Bee

In this challenge, I received lots of help from my tutor, Kourt Bailey. He helped me reorganize my .js file to flow better, and helped me with building the init(), getSubjectInfo(), buildMetadata() and optionChanged() functions. He explained JavaScript concepts throughout and coached me through building those functions. 

For the buildCharts() function, I used class activities and the Xpert Learning Assistant to help me with my code. Specifically, the Xpert Learning Assistant let me know how to make a bubble chart, and helped me troubleshoot the OTU IDs as labels for the bar chart, and eventually helped me build a function to name each OTU ID correctly. I also used this page: https://plotly.com/javascript/colorscales/ to help find colorful options for the bubble chart. 

Finally, I used this page on GitHub: https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site to help me deploy the app to GitHub Pages. 

You can find all code for the static page in my repository, and the published dashboard here: https://mbee19.github.io/belly-button-challenge/
